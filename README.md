# A GENERATOR OF ANIMAL MIX

Maybe for creating OCs that needs multiple animal classes.

## How it works?

### require = typeof function

#### Parameters

- (0) characterName [string] = The name of the character you want to put, IF undefined : it will generate AUTOMATICALLY a name.
- (1) needFirst [string] = If you want to keep the first side of the hyrbid, but you want another side to mix them both together, IF undefined : it will generate AUTOMATICALLY the two sides of the hybrid.
